# Project Title: AI Image Generation and Manipulation with Scade.Pro

## Short Description
This project focuses on AI-powered image generation, transformation, and enhancement using prompt-based image synthesis techniques. It employs advanced Fooocus AI models to generate images from text prompts while supporting image variation, face swapping, and upscaling functionalities. Users can provide specific image prompts and control weights to fine-tune the results.

## Key Components Involved
### Programming Language
- JSON-based AI workflow configuration

### Libraries/Tools Used
- **Fooocus** – AI-powered image generation tool
- **ControlNet** – for guided image modifications
- **FaceSwap** – for replacing faces in generated images
- **Image Upscaling** – to enhance resolution and sharpness

## Functionalities
- Generates AI-based images from textual descriptions
- Allows face swapping for modifications
- Supports multiple reference images for ControlNet-based guidance
- Offers image upscaling and variation options
- Customizable weight adjustments for different image elements
